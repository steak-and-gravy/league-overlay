# BB’s League Overlay

A lightweight desktop overlay for **iRacing** that gives you a clearer picture of your league division race within the race.  
BB’s League Overlay displays live standings and gaps with a focus on divisions. Gaps are to the next driver within your division, not just who is on track ahead of you.
